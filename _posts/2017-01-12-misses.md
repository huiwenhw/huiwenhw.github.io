After half a year of being away, I still miss the valley. Certain songs tend to trigger the memories and emotions I felt back when I was there. Its a feeling that's hard to put into words and I think only the people who were there with me would understand. Current song that's triggering these memories: Photograph - Ed Sheeran.
