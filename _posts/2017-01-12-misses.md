After half a year of being away, I still miss being in California. I don't know about you, but certain songs tend to trigger the memories and emotions I have of a certain period in time. Its a feeling that's hard to put into words and even though there're tons of songs that can trigger the memories, the one that led me to write this was: Photograph by Ed Sheeran.

I remember the usual highway we took.
The songs on the radio are always the same. 
We sang songs in the car, we talked about almost everything in the car.
Its amazing how much memories a small fiat can hold.
Thank you for being part of my NOC journey (J).
