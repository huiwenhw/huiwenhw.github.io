Hi



#Where do you start reading?

How do people know so much? That's the question I've always asked myself. 
Answer is, they read. And so, I've put a list together for some of the stuff I'd wanna read & hope that it'll be beneficial for you too.

Tech-ish
* [Hacker News Daily](http://www.daemonology.net/hn-daily/ "Hacker news daily")
* [Mybridge Top 10 articles](https://medium.mybridge.co/@Mybridge "Mybridge medium")

Non-Tech
* [Wait But Why](http://waitbutwhy.com "Wait But Why")
* [The Big Picture](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/bigpicture "Boston Globe")
