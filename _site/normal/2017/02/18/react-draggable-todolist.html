	<h2>Intro to React</h2>
	<h4>18 February 2017</h4>
</div>

<p>I had to create a draggable &amp; sortable todo list app, and I’ve tried React once using JSBin, so I figured it would be better to do everything from scratch so I know what’s going on. Found this <a href="http://andrewhfarmer.com/build-your-own-starter/#0-intro">tutorial online</a> &amp; I’m jotting down notes here!</p>

<p>#2 NPM</p>

<p>We add a package.json file to record our npm dependencies. Stuff that we add in the later steps are npm packages: Babel, Webpack, React etc. Adding a “node_modules” in .gitignore tells git to ignore the “node_modules” folder. It can be auto generated so we don’t need it! Since its now an npm project, the “npm install” command can be used to install all dependencies.</p>

<p>#3 Babel</p>

<p>Babel transforms the ES6 + JSX JS that we’ll be writing into ES5 JS that browsers can understand. We’ll write in a special syntax called JSX, which lets you put HTML-like code inside Javascript.</p>

<p>#4 Webpack</p>

<p>Webpack bundle all our JS together into a single file. This includes all the JS file that we write &amp; the npm packages. Reason: A single .js file is easier to deploy &amp; usually downloads faster than multiple small files. Webpack will work with Babel to convert our code from ES6/7 -&gt; ES5 while we work. Webpack also minifies our .js file for production.</p>

<p>babel-loader is a Webpack ‘loader’. It supports running Babel from Webpack.</p>

<p>#5 Express</p>

<p>A React dev env needs some way to show your app in a browser =&gt; which means, we’ll need a server. We’ll set up Express as our server.</p>

<p>Main file added here is server.js: It will run an Express server, which will run Webpack. Webpack will rerun whenever we change one of our JS files.</p>

<p>server.js is server-side JS. We can run it with the node server.js command. We’ll be adding a start script to run the server tooooo</p>

<p>Start by creating www/index.html as our first web page. Express is configured to serve all the files in the folder.</p>
